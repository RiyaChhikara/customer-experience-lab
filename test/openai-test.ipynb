      "Name: Robert Davis\n",
      "Age: 45\n",
      "Situation: Robert is a homeowner who is currently dealing with a plumbing emergency. His basement has started to flood which could potentially damage his property and belongings stored there. He urgently required plumbing assistance and called a service that promised to show up in 30 minutes. \n",
      "Emotional State: Robert is extremely frustrated and stressed. The wait for help has escalated his anxiety. The flooding in his basement is causing him to feel helpless and the unexpected costs are causing financial stress.\n",
      "Specific Frustration: His main frustration is the unprofessional behavior of the plumbing service. They promised to be there in 30 minutes but showed up 3 hours late. Moreover, the plumber was rude, charged an exorbitant amount just for inspection, and tried to upsell a full pipe replacement which he perceived as an attempt to scam him.\n",
      "What He Wants Resolved: Robert wants prompt, professional, and reasonably priced plumbing services. He needs his current emergency situation addressed immediately to prevent further damage to his property. He also wants assurance that he will not be overcharged or upsold unnecessary services in the future.\n"
